[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findclient_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "client_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "client_server"
  with any of the following names:

    client_serverConfig.cmake
    client_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "client_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "client_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "client_server" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
